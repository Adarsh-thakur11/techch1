challenge 2 :-
 
1. create a function
2. get the string ( ex- 00064833255500543076233434343400)
3. create the array with the same length as string
4. Traverse over the string to copy character at the i'th index of string to i'th index in the array.
5. length of the array is 'n' which same as string then
                                            for(int i=0 ; i<n; i++) 
                                                 {
                                                 if( i%2!=0)
                                                 {  
                                                    if(array[i]==0)
                                                        then remove the 0 at array[i] 
                                                    else 
                                                         print(" no more 0 present at even index);
                                                  }
                                                 else
                                                   {
                                                     if (array[i]==2) 
                                                         then swap the 2 with 0 at that array index
                                                    }
                                                  if(array[i]==0)
                                                     {
                                                       int count=0;
                                                       count++;
                                                       if (count>0)
                                                         {
                                                           then 
                                                           array[i-1] is removed
                                                           count =0;
                                                          }
                                               print the array;
                                             }
                                                      

                                                  
                                                  
6. goto step 5 and check if there is any 0 present at even indexes in the array
7. add commas after in between every 3 indexes  of the array
8. print the array which is the final output 
                                  ex:- 06,483,355,554,376,334,343,434
